This San Francisco vacation rental is located in the heart of Hayes Valley. Unlike some other parts of San Francisco, Hayes Valley has managed to retain a sense of community and a nonexclusive feel despite the fast build-up and high price tags. Some of the businesses that braved the less-than-savory days are still around, such as the Hayes Street Grill, now twice its original size.

It always cools down at night here, and can also be breezy. A leather jacket is perfect! --We recommend using the car services Uber and Lyft.

We can give you codes for discounts.  --You might consider renting a car for at least part of your stay in San Francisco.

You might also want to take a day-trip up to the Wine Country or Muir Woods, which are north of the city. --If you are parking a car in San Francisco, always turn the wheels so the car can't roll on a hill. If the car is pointed UPHILL, turn the wheels AWAY from the curb. If the car is pointed DOWNHILL, turn the wheels TOWARD the curb. --If you are interested in visiting Alcat","We are served by 2 bus lines and 1 tram line.

Whether for business or for pleasure, returning or visiting SF for the first time, it is a rewarding experience to meet such a great group of unique human beings.  \r\n\r\nOn Saturday 04/18/15, finished cleaning the attic - big spring cleaning project for 2015.  Besides the 500lbs of paper & old records taken to be shredded and recycled,  I was amazed at the 'treasures' found in the nooks and crannies of the 1892 attic. \r\n\r\nMedieval swords and weaponry, iron and gilded candelabras, old prints of Jon Snow (as a child), Brienne of Tarth (in full armor) and Daenerys Targaryen  (or is it Cersei Lannister?).  Take a peek at the added pictures of the transforming Game of Thrones dining room.   (LED Candles and Tapestries are on the way…) \r\n\r\n\r\nWe listen to our guest recommendations and continue to improve the place to met our guests needs.  \r\n\r\nI have recently started restoring and painting (with oils).

You will enjoy it as much as I have for the past 30+ years.  \r\n\r\nThe city is going through great changes that have people arguing the pros and cons of these changes.  Regardless of which position you espouse, the city is alive with energy that is catching and revitalizing. \r\n\r\nA city is only as dynamic as its people, and the tech revolution with its infusion of young adults have positively influenced San Francisco in wondrous ways.  For example, biking in San Francisco has nearly doubled since 2006 with protected bike lanes and closure of major portions Market Street to allow for bike and public transportation traffic.

(This definition includes the entire Lower Haight within Hayes Valley.)   A mixture of restaurants, small nightclubs, cafes, drinking establishments, residences, galleries, and hair salons characterizes Hayes Valley who has a population of Total5,672 and Lower Haight Population Total9,120","Rental Cars and Parking Most locals and frequent visitors to San Francisco (SF) would recommend against renting a car or getting to SF using their own car.  This is because parking in the city is expensive and at times, hard to find.  Overnight parking in the city may cost a visitor $30 to $50 per night and in some cases without in/out privileges.  Parking near most of the tourist areas, may cost the visitor about $12 to $15 dollars an hour in a parking lot.   Parking spots along the road are hard to find and if one does, they are all metered every day of the week in the visitor areas. Parking outside the visitor areas is timed for visitors who do not have a parking permit.  And a parking ticket in San Francisco starts at $86 for the fine. Even if one finds an empty parking spot, visitors have to check to see if parking is allowed at that time.  There are street cleaning times, rush hour periods when parking is not allowed. Parking fines/tickets or the car being towed is the last thing","The area is served by several San Francisco Municipal Railway (MUNI) bus lines and it is a few blocks away from all of the MUNI Metro lines. The heart of the neighborhood, at the corner of Fillmore and Haight, is six blocks away from the subway stop of Church and Market, which is also the location of the city's largest supermarket, a Safeway. Surveys show that this neighborhood has one of the highest number of daily trips by bike per capita of any San Francisco neighborhood[citation needed], and walking is also very popular. The geography of the Lower Haight lends itself to the most efficient bicycle routing from the Mission District towards Golden Gate Park and surrounding neighborhoods, and the popular bicycle route termed The Wiggle zig zags through this neighborhood.","Living Room, TV Room, Kitchen, Laundry, Outdoor Patio","As the flat has 3 guests staying on property most everyone gets to know each other but still has their own privacy.","Home:     A place where one lives; a residence. 2.

ZIPCARS: There is a Zip Car location one block from the apartment, they rent cars by the hour and by the day, please visit the ZIPCAR website for more information.

As an airbnb host during those near 7 years, I have met incredible and amazing people including not so nice individuals.  Also, as an airbnb guest, I have travelled and experienced different cultures, ate various cuisines reflective of people's culture, and saw the world through the prism of a foreigner.  As a result, my life is so much richer and am looking forward to the next 7 years and beyond with hopes of meeting more wonderful guests, traveling to other locations, and enriching every layer of my life.\r\n\r\nBy the way, I am also now a hobbyist beekeeper.

I'm Rachel.  I'm a bridge inspector on the SF Bay Area's toll bridges.  We inspect our bridges via rope access / rappelling, boats, walking on suspended catwalks, climbing, scrambling, and what I would call spelunking (instead of descending into caves, we go deep inside steel towers or concrete structures).\r\n\r\nI'm from the Kansas City area originally, and spent my teenage years in San Antonio, Texas.  Although I live in San Francisco now, I purchased vacation homes in San Antonio and Kansas City so I can stay connected to my roots. While fixing the places up and furnishing them, I've had help from friends and family as well as all kinds of wonderful trades people in Kansas City and San Antonio who have become my friends.  One of them even attended the same elementary school as me!  Meanwhile I stay at my vacation homes whenever I can, having friends over and hosting little family reunions, in between Airbnb guests.  It has truly been a wonderful experience.\r\n\r\nWhen I travel, I prefer to \"live like a local\" and stay in a bona fide neighborhood, in a well-cared for home with history and personality, rather than in a faceless corporate hotel.  As an Airbnb host, I bring that enthusiasm toward creating a wonderful space for my guests ... on the outside: in a fab neighborhood, convenient to public transit, bike lanes, walkable to a charming town center ... and on the inside: aesthetically pleasing, clean, modern, comfortable and practical in every way.   \r\n\r\nAbout me personally ... I'm into dancing, music, reading books, knitting, art, interior design, vegan food, nutrition, rock climbing, languages, hiking and camping, riding bikes, stretching, and running outdoors (not on a treadmill).

The neighborhood is hilly (this is San Francisco after all) but very walkable with Glen Park, food markets, shops and restaurants all within walking distance.

California had four years of drought and while we had more rain and snow this winter, we are still encouraged to conserve water as much as possible in the event the drought returns.\r\n\r\nSuffice to say I love nature and enjoy camping and hiking.  My favorite nature spot is being in the Redwoods and I never tire of Yosemite.   But there are so many other great nature places in California to visit and enjoy.\r\n\r\nI am a non-smoker and I apologize for having a very weak immune system but I am allergic to animal dander, cigarette smoke, dust, pollen and strong scents just to name a few.

It's peaceful, and we try to stay reasonably quiet until guests awake, but if you seek complete tranquility, then our home might not be the right fit. That said, only about 1% of our hundreds of previous guests have mentioned noise as an issue.  We like to know a bit about our guests, so please complete your Airbnb Profile before you book.

This San Francisco vacation rental is located in the heart of Hayes Valley. Unlike some other parts of San Francisco, Hayes Valley has managed to retain a sense of community and a nonexclusive feel despite the fast build-up and high price tags. Some of the businesses that braved the less-than-savory days are still around, such as the Hayes Street Grill, now twice its original size. But many of the shops sprouted up in the '90s, making Hayes Valley a real destination spot. The combination results in a wide diversity in clientele. While high-end San Franciscans sip $7 cocktails at Absinthe, down the street many are powering down an entire meal for around the same price at Flipper's.

It's a village within a city with lovely views, cafes & restaurants, parks, a library, a great bakery and grocery stores.   If you enjoy running or hiking, it's a perfect place to visit because you get the best of both worlds.  Also right down the hill is the Mission District which is chock-filled with restaurants, clubs and shops.  The top of Bernal Heights offers a spectacular 360 degree view of the city and the bay.  For those who have a car, there is plenty  free street parking on Ripley or adjacent streets in Bernal Heights during the day.  In the evenings, when neighbors return from work you may have to park in adjacent streets in the neighborhood.  Staying in  Bernal Heights during your visit to San Francisco will make you feel like you are an \"insider\" rather than a visitor living in a hotel downtown.</td><td>When sending an inquiry or a booking request please make sure that you have a complete profile filled out to include a clear photograph of yourself (and your companion if the room is booked for two).

I am totally fine with late arrivals and flexible about your departure if there isn't another guest arriving the same day you leave. Since meals are not provided, I highly recommend Precita Park Cafe at the corner of Alabama and Precita.   Also there are also alot of eateries and cafes on Cortland Ave which is on the south side of Bernal Heights.   Hilside Restaurant serves dinners and brunch on weekends.

The fastest way is to take either Uber or Lyft  from the airport to my address.  Make sure you go to the departure level of the airport to get your Uber or Lyft.   The BART train also goes right into the SFO Airport and will bring you down to the 24th/Mission station in about 30 minutes.  At 24th Street, there is a MUNI 67 Bus that can bring you up the hill to Ripley Street at the corner of Folsom Street.   Note that walking uphill to Ripley Street is very strenuous, especially if you have luggage! Most guests either use Uber or Lyft from the airport to my condo.   But there are also shared van rides like Super Shuttle.  In addition, there is the BART train that you can take from the airport to the 24th Street/Mission station and then either taxi, Uber/Lyft or take the 67 Muni Bus up to Bernal Heights and get off at Ripley Street. Finally, there is the option to rent a car from the Airport but remember to never leave anything in </td><td>Guests will be given a set of keys to the condo and entrance gate and will have free access to come and go as they please.  On arrival, please press the lower left bell on the pad outside the Ripley Condominiums white wrought-iron gate and you will be buzzed in.   The bathroom is shared but has never been a problem with all the numerous guests that I have hosted.   The master bedroom, the loft and the garage are OFF LIMITS.</td><td>Interaction is as little or as much as the guest(s) desire.   I will not be hurt or offended if you want to be left alone.

I love to travel and enjoy meeting new and interesting people.  I am passionate about music and enjoy almost anything to do with the Arts.  On a cold rainy day I love a good book or movie.  I especially appreciate good company and good conversation but I also like my privacy and alone time. I am a foodie and am always looking for good restaurants or eateries and am blessed that San Francisco has many of these. \r\n\r\nI totally subscribe to living a sustainable life-style and appreciate if you join me in creating a greener planet.  California had four years of drought and while we had more rain and snow this winter, we are still encouraged to conserve water as much as possible in the event the drought returns.\r\n\r\nSuffice to say I love nature and enjoy camping and hiking.  My favorite nature spot is being in the Redwoods and I never tire of Yosemite.   But there are so many other great nature places in California to visit and enjoy.\r\n\r\nI am a non-smoker and I apologize for having a very weak immune system but I am allergic to animal dander, cigarette smoke, dust, pollen and strong scents just to name a few.  All my bedding has hypo-allergenic encasings.   \r\n\r\nI work from home and so am flexible about check-in and check-out times depending on whether I already have a guest and if I have meetings, etc..\r\niI have a full time job and while I work at home most of the time, occasionally I do visit customers or need to run personal errands.  I would appreciate confirmed guests letting me in advance their time of arrival and departure.   \r\n\r\nAlso my condo address is not going to be visible from the street level so please read carefully directions to my place and how to contact me as you turn in my street so I can look out for you.   \r\n\r\nPlease do not bother neighbors if you cannot figure out where address is when you arrive.  Just call me at my home phone or send me a text message!  \r\n\r\nThank You and looking forward to making your acquaintance.\r\n\r\nCecilia\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</td><td>within an hour</td><td>100%</td><td>N/A</td><td>t</td><td>https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/18732/profile_pic/1269218075/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small</td><td>https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/18732/profile_pic/1269218075/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium</td><td>Bernal Heights</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>['email', 'phone', 'facebook', 'reviews', 'kba', 'work_email']</td><td>t</td><td>t</td><td>San Francisco, CA, United States</td><td>Bernal Heights</td><td>Bernal Heights</td><td>null</td><td>San Francisco</td><td>CA</td><td>94110</td><td>San Francisco</td><td>San Francisco, CA</td><td>US</td><td>United States</td><td>37.74556</td><td>-122.41207</td><td>t</td><td>Condominium</td><td>Private room</td><td>1</td><td>1.0</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>Real Bed</td><td>{TV,\"Cable TV\",Internet,Wifi,Kitchen,\"Free street parking\",\"Buzzer/wireless intercom\",Heating,\"Smoke detector\",\"Carbon monoxide detector\",\"First aid kit\",\"Fire extinguisher\",Essentials,Shampoo,\"24-hour check-in\",Hangers,\"Hair dryer\",Iron,\"Laptop friendly workspace\",\"translation missing: en.hosting_amenity_49\",\"translation missing: en.hosting_amenity_50\",\"Private entrance\",\"Hot water\",\"Bed linens\",Microwave,\"Coffee maker\",Refrigerator,Dishwasher,\"Dishes and silverware\",\"Cooking basics\",Oven,Stove,\"Patio or balcony\",\"Luggage dropoff allowed\",\"Host greets you\"}</td><td>null</td><td>$100.00</td><td>$750.00</td><td>$2,800.00</td><td>$500.00</td><td>$30.00</td><td>1</td><td>$30.00</td><td>3</td><td>29</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>29</td><td>29</td><td>3.0</td><td>29.0</td><td>4 days ago</td><td>t</td><td>12</td><td>40</td><td>70</td><td>345</td><td>2019-03-06</td><td>234</td><td>29</td><td>2010-04-19</td><td>2019-02-15</td><td>98</td><td>10</td><td>10</td><td>10</td><td>10</td><td>10</td><td>10</td><td>t</td><td>STR-0000557</td><td>{\"SAN FRANCISCO\"}</td><td>t</td><td>f</td><td>strict_14_with_grace_period</td><td>t</td><td>t</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>2.16</td></tr><tr><td>23630</td><td>https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/23630</td><td>20190306152813</td><td>2019-03-06</td><td>Castro Guest Suite With Continental Breakfast</td><td>A perfect hotel alternative, our fully furnished suite is a private retreat complete with queen-sized Tempur-Pedic bed, high-quality linens and towels, tranquil garden, in-suite continental breakfast items (food & beverage included in the suite's refrigerator) and spa-like luxury bathroom.

In the summertime, when much of the city is covered in chilly fog, our neighborhood usually has sunshine. The neighborhood has great views and it's very quiet but, yet, you can quickly get downtown or to the trendy (but rowdy) Mission District. We have an assortment of great local restaurants within walking distance (we provide restaurant menus and a map), and you can even organize a tour of San Francisco's most famous historic brewery, Anchor Steam, which is a few blocks away. There are 2 markets and a great little organic grocery store within an easy walk. We have a wonderful bookstore, independent coffee houses and cute shops on the main business street in the neighborhood. See photos of them in the photo section of our listing.</td><td>SAN FRANCISCO TIPS: --Bring a jacket, no matter what time of year you are visiting. It always cools down at night here, and can also be breezy. A leather jacket is perfect! --We recommend using the car services Uber and Lyft. They are much less expensive than taxis and more efficient than public transportation. We can give you codes for discounts.  --You might consider renting a car for at least part of your stay in San Francisco. Our neighborhood is well-served by mass transit, but some of the worthwhile attractions (such as the deYoung Museum) are far from the downtown, Union Square and Fisherman's Wharf areas. You might also want to take a day-trip up to the Wine Country or Muir Woods, which are north of the city. --If you are parking a car in San Francisco, always turn the wheels so the car can't roll on a hill. If the car is pointed UPHILL, turn the wheels AWAY from the curb. If the car is pointed DOWNHILL, turn the wheels TOWARD the curb. --If you are interested in visiting Alcat</td><td>We are served by 2 bus lines and 1 tram line. The #22 bus, which goes to the Mission District, Pacific Heights and the Marina District, stops 1 block from our house. The #10 bus, which goes downtown, near Union Square, the Financial District, and Pacific Heights, stops 3 blocks from our house. The \"T\" tram is about a 10-minute walk from our house, and it goes downtown, to the baseball stadium, to the waterfront, and connects with other transportation that will take you anywhere in the city, including Fisherman's Wharf and Pier 39. The #22 bus and the \"T\" tram also connect with the BART transportation system, which goes to the airport. By taxi, our house is about 15 minutes from the San Francisco Airport. Lyft or Uber is also an excellent option for getting around town and our recommended way to get here from the airport. If you aren't a member of these car services, we can provide you with a coupon code for a discount on your first ride. Just ask! There is also a bike-share docking sta</td><td>The guest suite is located on the lower level of our private house, at street level. To reach it, you enter through a pedestrian door, then pass through the garage to the rear of the house. The guest suite has a private entrance. There are two steps up to enter the suite. Because the house is built into a hill, the back of the guest suite cuts partially into the hill. Our backyard is terraced. When you exit the private back door onto the garden, there are 11 steps up to reach the main deck. The suite is very quiet because it is located away from the street.  Guests have access to the back deck and garden, which has a table and chairs, and gas BBQ (please check with us for instructions before using the BBQ).  We have a washer and dryer - but guests are not allowed to operate the washer. We are happy to operate it for you. The charge for laundry is $5 per load.

You will enjoy it as much as I have for the past 30+ years.  \r\n\r\nThe city is going through great changes that have people arguing the pros and cons of these changes.  Regardless of which position you espouse, the city is alive with energy that is catching and revitalizing. \r\n\r\nA city is only as dynamic as its people, and the tech revolution with its infusion of young adults have positively influenced San Francisco in wondrous ways.  For example, biking in San Francisco has nearly doubled since 2006 with protected bike lanes and closure of major portions Market Street to allow for bike and public transportation traffic.

It's an easy walk to the Castro, Haight Street, Hayes Valley, and Noe Valley. And we're close to BART and Muni, so it's easy to visit the Ferry Building, Union Square, Downtown... Everywhere!  Then again, you might not want to leave the neighborhood at all... Here's a very incomplete list of spots within a few blocks of our home: Foodie Heaven: Tartine, Delfina, Bi Rite Market and Creamery, Mission Chinese Food, Lolo, Locanda, Foreign Cinema, Smitten, the list goes on - and seems to grow daily!

With neighbors directly above, right and left, you might hear footsteps, dogs barking, babies crying, any manner of \"city\" and/or \"roommate\" noise. It's peaceful, and we try to stay reasonably quiet until guests awake, but if you seek complete tranquility, then our home might not be the right fit. That said, only about 1% of our hundreds of previous guests have mentioned noise as an issue.  We like to know a bit about our guests, so please complete your Airbnb Profile before attempting to book.  If you plan to arrive later than 10:00 PM, please let us know BEFORE booking. If you book first, and then tell us about your late arrival, we'll request a $50 Late Check In Fee.  Please check your total price before booking. Our pricing varies, and can be higher on weekends and during \"high\" season, and there's also a cleaning fee, and a sur-charge for extra guests.  We do not offer discounts for long</td><td>It's an easy and lovely 10 minute stroll to the 16th St/Mission BART Station, and there are Muni Routes all around us, so there's easy access to SFO, Union Square, Moscone Center, Market Street, the Ferry Building, Golden Gate Park, AT&T Park... Everywhere!  Our neighborhood is great for bicycling, too: Flat, with dedicated bike lanes on both Valencia Street and 17th Street. And we're both avid riders, and love to share the city's cycling secrets. (Trust us: You want to know about the Wiggle before you set off to Golden Gate Park.)  The 101 and 280 freeways are also nearby, but parking in our neighborhood is tough. (There is a parking garage three blocks away, ~$25/day.)</td><td>Guests have their own suite, with a large bedroom / sitting area, \"en-suite\" bathroom, and exclusive use of the garden. Access to the suite is through the house, and down a flight of stairs. The stairs are old, steep, and narrow. Please take a look at the photos in our listing, and make sure the stairs won't be any trouble.  You will most likely be sharing the \"Common\" areas in our home with a \"Guest Host\" who'll be filling in for Wendy and I, and there may also be another room of Airbnb guests, too. Common areas include the living room and sunporch, as well as the kitchen, which may be used for storing and re-heating food and making light \"snacks\" but not for cooking full meals. Please, no real cooking without prior permission. (With all the amazing restaurants nearby, who wants to cook???)</td><td>This is usually our own bedroom, so if it's available, it might be because we're away. If we are both away, you will be sharing our home with a \"Guest Host\" - someone who'll be around to ensure your comfort, and to happily point you toward the traditional tourist sites or the hidden hotspots, whatever your preference. There may also be another room of Airbnb Guests, upstairs, in our Mission Sunshine listing. Guest interaction covers the full range, from sharing dinner or drinks, to rarely seeing each other. It all depends on preferences and schedules.</td><td>Quiet Hours are 10:30 PM to 8:00 AM on weeknights, 12:00 AM to 10:00 AM on weekends. Those are not \"lock out\" hours, you may come and go as you like, but if you are home during Quiet Hours, please keep noise to a minimum: No late night showers, no audio without headphones, no sitting and talking in the garden, etc. (Our neighborhood is authentic \"San Francisco\" in its density and architecture, so there are neighbors very nearby, and sound travels surprisingly well in the still of the night, and through the lightwells between buildings.) No Smoking, anywhere on the property, or within 25 feet of the front gate. (No Smoking in the Garden, No Smoking on the front stairs.)  Please note the picture of the stairs down to this room. I like to think of them as \"charmingly old\" - which means steep, dark and narrow, with a handrail that only goes half way up. Please be sure that everyone in your party will be comfortable going up and down these stairs.

(This definition includes the entire Lower Haight within Hayes Valley.)   A mixture of restaurants, small nightclubs, cafes, drinking establishments, residences, galleries, and hair salons characterizes Hayes Valley who has a population of Total5,672 and Lower Haight Population Total9,120</td><td>Rental Cars and Parking Most locals and frequent visitors to San Francisco (SF) would recommend against renting a car or getting to SF using their own car.  This is because parking in the city is expensive and at times, hard to find.  Overnight parking in the city may cost a visitor $30 to $50 per night and in some cases without in/out privileges.  Parking near most of the tourist areas, may cost the visitor about $12 to $15 dollars an hour in a parking lot.   Parking spots along the road are hard to find and if one does, they are all metered every day of the week in the visitor areas. Parking outside the visitor areas is timed for visitors who do not have a parking permit.  And a parking ticket in San Francisco starts at $86 for the fine. Even if one finds an empty parking spot, visitors have to check to see if parking is allowed at that time.  There are street cleaning times, rush hour periods when parking is not allowed. Parking fines/tickets or the car being towed is the last thing</td><td>The area is served by several San Francisco Municipal Railway (MUNI) bus lines and it is a few blocks away from all of the MUNI Metro lines. The heart of the neighborhood, at the corner of Fillmore and Haight, is six blocks away from the subway stop of Church and Market, which is also the location of the city's largest supermarket, a Safeway. Surveys show that this neighborhood has one of the highest number of daily trips by bike per capita of any San Francisco neighborhood[citation needed], and walking is also very popular. The geography of the Lower Haight lends itself to the most efficient bicycle routing from the Mission District towards Golden Gate Park and surrounding neighborhoods, and the popular bicycle route termed The Wiggle zig zags through this neighborhood.</td><td>Living Room, TV Room, Kitchen, Laundry, Outdoor Patio</td><td>As the flat has 3 guests staying on property most everyone gets to know each other but still has their own privacy.</td><td>Home:     A place where one lives; a residence. 2.

Walker's Paradise score of 97, EASY walking distance to great shopping, restaurants and cafes, organic grocery store, parks, movie theaters, the Presidio, Golden Gate Bridge, Fisherman's Wharf, Ghiridelli Square, Lombard street and public transportation.  Fully furnished bedroom, private bath, full private closet, desk, wireless internet, washer/dryer in unit, high ceilings, working fireplace, lots of light, one car garage parking and 20 yards from Zip Car pick up and drop off. The neighborhood is vibrant and alive. Unbelievably delicious places to eat one block from the apartment but far enough away from the 'scene' that it is quiet and relaxing. MUNI buses are one block from your room to anywhere in the city.

You could have a fantastic three days and never get in a car.  Of course you wouldn't do that because the rest of the city is so special....but if you just wanted a place to stay for awhile where literally everything you could want you could walk to, this is the place. Golden Gate Bridge, Crissy field, Fisherman's wharf, Palace of Fine Arts, Fort Mason, shopping, eating, drinking.</td><td>Calling all Cat People!!   If you are a cat lover and are comfortable doing kitty care when I travel there is another 10% discount on top of the monthly discount listed already.  It's easy. They're easy. All they do is sleep really.  (:</td><td>Buses one block away. To get from the airport, if you have light or few bags take BART to Powell Street or Embarcadero and take an Uber, Lyft or cab. Easily found. For going to other parts of the city, Uber and Lyft rarely make you wait for a ride there are hundreds around at all times - they're often in front of the building before I get down the steps!</td><td>Kitchen.</td><td>It depends on what they like.  I enjoy interacting and and just as happy not to.  I don't have a rule for it. I am sometimes there and often not. I usually discuss this with the prospect guest during the booking process.</td><td>The main house rule is wearing shoes inside as little as possible. Bring socks to walk around in and my downstairs neighbor will be so much happier! Not a fan of clutter - you room is your domain but please put coffee cups and plates directly into the dishwasher, wash them by hand or at least put them in the sink if you are in a rush. Common space should be clutter free and inviting to all.  Guest bathroom is used rarely (but sometimes) by my friends. Please keep it presentable.</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/3971579/f4b0cfec_original.jpg?aki_policy=large</td><td>null</td><td>237691</td><td>https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/237691</td><td>Regina</td><td>2010-09-17</td><td>San Francisco, California, United States</td><td>Hi I'm a professional woman who loves to dance, cook, do yoga and windsurf.

However, you can check-in as LATE as you want, or check out as EARLY as you want ... because we have a spiffy electronic key pad entry system!  Yay for technology!   We e-mail you the key code before your arrival ... we pick a unique code for each guest, and we delete the code after you leave.  When you get here, it doesn't matter how late ... 2 A.M., no problem!  You can let yourself in and start getting settled in, or crash on the comfy bed, or even make some coffee and stay up all night watching DVDs, we don't care!  The point is, you have independent access and can come and go whenever you want.  Just be sure to arrive after 3:00 p.m. on your check-in and date, and depart prior to 10 a.m. on your check-out day.

While fixing the places up and furnishing them, I've had help from friends and family as well as all kinds of wonderful trades people in Kansas City and San Antonio who have become my friends.  One of them even attended the same elementary school as me!  Meanwhile I stay at my vacation homes whenever I can, having friends over and hosting little family reunions, in between Airbnb guests.  It has truly been a wonderful experience.\r\n\r\nWhen I travel, I prefer to \"live like a local\" and stay in a bona fide neighborhood, in a well-cared for home with history and personality, rather than in a faceless corporate hotel.  As an Airbnb host, I bring that enthusiasm toward creating a wonderful space for my guests ... on the outside: in a fab neighborhood, convenient to public transit, bike lanes, walkable to a charming town center ... and on the inside: aesthetically pleasing, clean, modern, comfortable and practical in every way.   \r\n\r\nAbout me personally ... I'm into dancing, music, reading books, knitting, art, interior design, vegan food, nutrition, rock climbing, languages, hiking and camping, riding bikes, stretching, and running outdoors (not on a treadmill).   As I don't watch TV or read newspapers, I learn about \"what's happening out there\" via the radio (NPR), the books I read, the people I talk to, and of course: the internet.  :)  I may be clueless about the latest TV shows or celebrity gossip, but I can talk with you about a zillion other things if you like.  :)</td><td>within a few hours</td><td>100%</td><td>N/A</td><td>f</td><td>https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/354456/profile_pic/1297181709/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small</td><td>https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/354456/profile_pic/1297181709/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium</td><td>Noe Valley</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>['email', 'phone', 'facebook', 'reviews', 'kba']</td><td>t</td><td>t</td><td>San Francisco, CA, United States</td><td>Noe Valley</td><td>Bernal Heights</td><td>null</td><td>San Francisco</td><td>CA</td><td>94110</td><td>San Francisco</td><td>San Francisco, CA</td><td>US</td><td>United States</td><td>37.74527</td><td>-122.42424</td><td>t</td><td>Apartment</td><td>Entire home/apt</td><td>3</td><td>1.0</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>Real Bed</td><td>{TV,Internet,Wifi,Kitchen,Breakfast,\"Free street parking\",Heating,\"Family/kid friendly\",Washer,Dryer,\"Smoke detector\",\"Carbon monoxide detector\",\"First aid kit\",\"Safety card\",\"Fire extinguisher\",Essentials,Shampoo,\"24-hour check-in\",Hangers,\"Hair dryer\",Iron,\"Laptop friendly workspace\",\"Self check-in\",Keypad,\"Pack ’n Play/travel crib\",\"Hot water\",\"Luggage dropoff allowed\",\"Long term stays allowed\"}</td><td>null</td><td>$108.00</td><td>null</td><td>$3,300.00</td><td>$500.00</td><td>null</td><td>2</td><td>$0.00</td><td>31</td><td>180</td><td>31</td><td>31</td><td>180</td><td>180</td><td>31.0</td><td>180.0</td><td>2 weeks ago</td><td>t</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>249</td><td>2019-03-06</td><td>10</td><td>0</td><td>2012-03-25</td><td>2016-08-20</td><td>98</td><td>10</td><td>10</td><td>10</td><td>10</td><td>10</td><td>10</td><td>t</td><td>null</td><td>{\"SAN FRANCISCO\"}</td><td>f</td><td>f</td><td>strict_14_with_grace_period</td><td>f</td><td>f</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0.12</td></tr><tr><td>70284</td><td>https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/70284</td><td>20190306152813</td><td>2019-03-06</td><td>Monthly Shared Home for Students 1</td><td>Welcome to our home for budget-minded students, interns and J-1 work abroad participants visiting San Francisco for 1 to 6 months.

Alternatively, we know of some first come, first served free street parking across the city.

Check out must be by 11am, the day of departure.   As a travelers house, all guests are required to have a government issued photo ID and proof of traveling status (i.e. plane tickets or passport).   You will be asked for a $20 refundable security deposit at check-in.    Most of our rules are common sense and will be explained at check-in.

Our neighborhood has little traffic, is quiet with charming alleyways and a nice park (Glen Park) a few blocks away. We say it is like living in the suburbs but still has all the benefits of living in a city. The neighborhood is hilly (this is San Francisco after all) but very walkable with Glen Park, food markets, shops and restaurants all within walking distance. In the summer, we often have sunny days when other parts of the city are fogged in.</td><td>Kitchenette amenities include: small refrigerator with freezer, large toaster over (convection and broil), hot plate, coffee pot, microwave, tea kettle, silverware, plates, bowls and cups. Although the kitchenette does not have a sink, our guests use the bathroom sink to wash dishes. All bedding, towels, cleaning supplies and laundry detergent are included as well as an iron, ironing board and hair dryer.  We have one cat, Moochie, but she never accesses the studio. We have had guests that were allergic to cats, therefore, we ensure our cat never accesses the studio so allergies are not an issue. Moochie does, however, access the shared hallway to the studio, as well as the shared areas - the basement and backyard.

The only parking restrictions are the 2nd & 4th Tuesday & Friday 9 – 11am for street cleaning. Tuesday’s, the East side of the street, Friday’s the West. There is signage on the street to remind you.</td><td>The studio is on the ground floor of our home, we live upstairs. The bottom floor basement leads out to a large backyard.

However, we are both busy working professionals so may not be home when you arrive.  We’ll come down to check you in if we are home.

You should not only be willing to clean up after yourself but be willing to do a little extra to help a housemate or the community.   This is a sample of some of the house rules.   A complete list of house rules will need to be agreed to prior to move in. 1.   STUDENTS ONLY - This home is intended for short term accommodation for visiting students only.   You must maintain your student, intern or educational work exchange status to stay here. 2.

There is street parking surrounding my home,  but on the weekdays it's often 2 hour maximum.  Weekends there's no maximum but it's not always easy to find a spot - especially if you're not used to city parking conditions. If you're bringing a car, I highly suggest you inquire about parking.  I do have a spot in the garage. It's not guaranteed, but typically I can work it out for you.</td><td>•The famous cable car picks up 2 blocks up the hill.

Stroll along the Mission's wide avenues and you'll be struck by the profusion of taquerias, pupuserias, produce markets, Salvadoran bakeries, salon de bellezas (beauty salons), and marketas -- all evidence of the Central American and Mexican families that have been settling the Mission en masse since the 1950s. You'll also notice plenty of cafés, thrift shops and used-book stores that cater to the college grads, artists, activists and other alterna-types that have historically been drawn to the Mission. The Internet boom brought on heavy gentrification -- trendy restaurants and boutiques blazed in, rents shot up and many Latinos and artists were displaced by the influx of highly paid young professionals.

My neighbor downstairs does not like people hearing people walking around in shoes, especially with hard soles so please bring flip flops or walk around in socks or bare feet while in the condo.</td><td>I will be happy to provide you with my Uber and Lyft promo codes so you can get some discount rides.   The 24th/Mission BART station is about a 12 minute walk from Bernal Heights and is the fastest way to get downtown.  The MUNI 67 bus comes up Bernal Heights and does a loop around the Bernal Hill and to 24th and Mission.  If you don't feel like walking up or down the hill, the bus stops at the end of my street.  Freeway 101 and 280 are both bordering Bernal Heights so there is very easy access to the East or South Bay if you are driving.   Use the BART train on Mission & 24th street to get downtown in 5-7 minutes.  If you have a Smart phone or an iPhone, install Lyft or Uber to get a driver in 5 minutes or less.  Super Shuttle is a shared van ride to and from the airport but I usually take BART and then either Lyft or Uber up the hill from the 24th and Mission BART station.

Please respect the neighbors and do not bother them.   This is a 6 unit condo building and most of the residents have lived here for 20 years or more.

All front doors of each condo look exactly alike so please ensure you are opening the door to the correct condo unit.</td><td>No  shoes worn inside the unit.  Bring flip-flops soft-soled bedroom slippers.     Only flush toilet paper down the toilet.  If the toilet plugs up, your security deposit will be used to pay the plumber. No smoking.  Must go outside the building to smoke.  No parties, loud music or noise that will disrupt the peace and annoy the neighbors.  No extra guests coming over without permission from the hosts. Definitely no overnight guests besides the approved guests.   Please respect the neighbors. No heavy drinking or drunken, quarrelsome behavior. No pets as I am highly allergic to animal dander. If you break something please advise the owner and be prepared to replace it.</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/2170765/56e16016_original.jpg?aki_policy=large</td><td>null</td><td>18732</td><td>https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/18732</td><td>Cecilia</td><td>2009-05-25</td><td>United States</td><td>I am a LEGAL San Francisco Short Term Rental Host and possess both a STR Permit and a Business License.\r\n\r\nSan Francisco has been my home for 25 years and I love my condo, my neighborhood and my city!  \r\n\r\nI've lived in many places abroad and in the US but by far, San Francisco is my favorite place in the whole wide world.   \r\n\r\nHaving said that, I would like to visit the whole wide world!!  I love to travel and enjoy meeting new and interesting people.  I am passionate about music and enjoy almost anything to do with the Arts.  On a cold rainy day I love a good book or movie.  I especially appreciate good company and good conversation but I also like my privacy and alone time. I am a foodie and am always looking for good restaurants or eateries and am blessed that San Francisco has many of these. \r\n\r\nI totally subscribe to living a sustainable life-style and appreciate if you join me in creating a greener planet.  California had four years of drought and while we had more rain and snow this winter, we are still encouraged to conserve water as much as possible in the event the drought returns.\r\n\r\nSuffice to say I love nature and enjoy camping and hiking.  My favorite nature spot is being in the Redwoods and I never tire of Yosemite.   But there are so many other great nature places in California to visit and enjoy.\r\n\r\nI am a non-smoker and I apologize for having a very weak immune system but I am allergic to animal dander, cigarette smoke, dust, pollen and strong scents just to name a few.  All my bedding has hypo-allergenic encasings.   \r\n\r\nI work from home and so am flexible about check-in and check-out times depending on whether I already have a guest and if I have meetings, etc..\r\niI have a full time job and while I work at home most of the time, occasionally I do visit customers or need to run personal errands.  I would appreciate confirmed guests letting me in advance their time of arrival and departure.   \r\n\r\nAlso my condo address is not going to be visible from the street level so please read carefully directions to my place and how to contact me as you turn in my street so I can look out for you.   \r\n\r\nPlease do not bother neighbors if you cannot figure out where address is when you arrive.  Just call me at my home phone or send me a text message!  \r\n\r\nThank You and looking forward to making your acquaintance.\r\n\r\nCecilia\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</td><td>within an hour</td><td>100%</td><td>N/A</td><td>t</td><td>https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/18732/profile_pic/1269218075/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small</td><td>https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/18732/profile_pic/1269218075/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium</td><td>Bernal Heights</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>['email', 'phone', 'facebook', 'reviews', 'kba', 'work_email']</td><td>t</td><td>t</td><td>Bernal Heights, San Francisco, CA, United States</td><td>Bernal Heights</td><td>Bernal Heights</td><td>null</td><td>Bernal Heights, San Francisco</td><td>CA</td><td>94110</td><td>San Francisco</td><td>Bernal Heights, San Francisco, CA</td><td>US</td><td>United States</td><td>37.74531</td><td>-122.41122</td><td>t</td><td>Condominium</td><td>Entire home/apt</td><td>4</td><td>1.0</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>Real Bed</td><td>{TV,\"Cable TV\",Internet,Wifi,Kitchen,\"Free street parking\",\"Buzzer/wireless intercom\",Heating,\"Smoke detector\",\"Carbon monoxide detector\",\"First aid kit\",\"Fire extinguisher\",Essentials,Shampoo,\"24-hour check-in\",Hangers,\"Hair dryer\",Iron,\"Laptop friendly workspace\",\"translation missing: en.hosting_amenity_49\",\"translation missing: en.hosting_amenity_50\",\"Hot water\",\"Bed linens\",\"Extra pillows and blankets\",Microwave,\"Coffee maker\",Refrigerator,Dishwasher,\"Dishes and silverware\",\"Cooking basics\",Oven,Stove,\"Patio or balcony\",\"Long term stays allowed\",\"Host greets you\"}</td><td>null</td><td>$225.00</td><td>$1,200.00</td><td>null</td><td>$500.00</td><td>$100.00</td><td>4</td><td>$50.00</td><td>14</td><td>29</td><td>14</td><td>14</td><td>29</td><td>29</td><td>14.0</td><td>29.0</td><td>3 weeks ago</td><td>t</td><td>5</td><td>6</td><td>6</td><td>36</td><td>2019-03-06</td><td>6</td><td>0</td><td>2011-10-03</td><td>2017-07-28</td><td>100</td><td>10</td><td>10</td><td>10</td><td>10</td><td>10</td><td>10</td><td>t</td><td>STR-0000557</td><td>{\"SAN FRANCISCO\"}</td><td>t</td><td>f</td><td>strict_14_with_grace_period</td><td>t</td><td>t</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0.07</td></tr><tr><td>183859</td><td>https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/183859</td><td>20190306152813</td><td>2019-03-06</td><td>Family-Friendly Flat In San Francisco, CA.
